# ðŸš€ Competitive Programming Playground

This repository contains all my code from **Codeforces problems**, **ICPC training**, and various algorithmic challenges.  
It serves as a personal archive to track my growth, experiment with different approaches, and build mastery in **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving under pressure**.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

I believe that competitive programming is one of the best ways to:

- Sharpen algorithmic thinking.
- Master data structures deeply.
- Improve coding speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for contests such as ICPC, Codeforces rounds, and technical interviews.
